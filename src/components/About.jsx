  I'm a <strong>Data Analyst & Data Science/AI-ML Enthusiast</strong> and <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> focused on clean, accessible, and modern UI/UX with a strong data-driven mindset.
  I work primarily with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Power BI</strong>, transforming data into actionable insights, interactive dashboards, and lightweight ML prototypes.
  <br /><br />
  I build user-friendly web interfaces and toolsâ€”from analytics dashboards and reporting views to interactive appsâ€”balancing usability, performance, and clarity to solve real-world problems.
  <br /><br />
  I'm also an active <strong>problem solver</strong>, with 600+ problems solved across LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. I regularly participate in coding contests and have recently started competing on Codeforces.
  <br /><br />
  My goal is to grow into a <strong>Data Scientist</strong>, applying statistical thinking, machine learning, and thoughtful design to deliver measurable impact.
